# Godot 4 Patterns Reference

Domain knowledge for Godot 4 + GDScript development. Five reference files provide detailed guidance:

- [Scene Architecture](./references/scene-architecture.md) — composition, signals, dependency injection, scene unique nodes, groups
- [GDScript Quality](./references/gdscript-quality.md) — member ordering, naming conventions, typing rules, state machines, patterns
- [Resource System](./references/resource-system.md) — `res://` paths, `.uid` files, Resource sharing pitfalls, `.duplicate()`, loading patterns
- [Timing & Async](./references/timing-async.md) — signal emission timing, `await` races, `queue_free()` safety, `call_deferred()`, autoload order
- [Export & Builds](./references/export-builds.md) — export presets, dynamic load tracking, platform gotchas, `.uid` consistency

## Core Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **Composition over inheritance.** Assemble entities from single-purpose child nodes. Limit scene inheritance to one layer.
2. **"Call down, signal up."** Parents call children's methods. Children emit signals. Siblings communicate through shared parent.
3. **Resources hold data; Nodes hold behavior.** Custom Resource classes for item definitions, stat blocks, configs. Nodes only where scene-tree integration is needed.
4. **Static typing is mandatory.** Every variable, parameter, and return type must be typed. Typed GDScript runs 28-59% faster.
5. **Performance is architectural.** `set_process(false)` on off-screen objects, `process_mode = DISABLED` for subtrees, Server APIs for high-count entities.
